    p_about: `I'm Sebastián Machado Cano, a passionate software developer and dedicated 
    problem solver who believes that perseverance and determination can overcome any 
    technical challenge. While I may be shy and quiet by nature, I channel my energy 
    into crafting innovative and scalable solutions that speak louder than words. With 
    solid experience in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js, and React), along 
    with Next.js, TypeScript, and PHP with MySQL, I've learned that technical knowledge 
    is just the foundation, what truly matters is the relentless drive to make things work, 
    regardless of the effort required. My core expertise lies in Python and backend 
    development, where I apply my methodical and persistent approach to solve complex 
    problems. I also enjoy exploring Rust as a hobby. Known for my adaptability, 
    long-term problem-solving vision, and unwavering commitment to seeing projects 
    through to completion, I hold a degree in "Analysis and Development of Information 
    Systems" and am currently pursuing Computer Engineering. I may work quietly, but 
    I deliver results that make an impact.`,

    u_p_d_heatmap: `
    I developed a sophisticated SEO ranking system similar to LocalDominator that analyzes business 
    positions for specific keywords across geographic locations. Given a keyword and business coordinates, 
    the system ranks that business from 1 to 20 compared to competitors. This isn't a basic CRUD application - 
    it requires advanced programming skills to implement complex algorithms for data comparison, geographic 
    analysis, and real-time ranking calculations. The system processes massive datasets and provides 
    actionable SEO insights for local businesses.

    away from the target business, searches using specific keywords, and performs intelligent clicks 
    when the business is found. If not located, it expands the search radius in 7-mile increments 
    until discovered. The bot includes sophisticated monthly goal planning - if a business needs 200 
    iterations and it's the 15th with 0 completed, it calculates optimal daily distribution to meet targets.
    `,

    solution handles sensitive legal documents with proper authentication, validation, and cloud 
    storage integration, ensuring data security and regulatory compliance.
    `,

    u_p_d_wordpress_ai: `
    I'm developing an intelligent WordPress plugin that leverages AI to automatically generate pages, 
    posts, and custom styles based on user configurations. The system schedules content creation 
    at specified intervals, ensuring consistent website updates without manual intervention. This 
    cutting-edge solution combines AI content generation with WordPress automation, creating a 
    powerful tool for content management and website maintenance.
